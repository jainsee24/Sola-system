3D Simulation of Solar System using OpenGl: A Visualization of solar system with Functionalities such as Lighting, Texture, Sun, eight planets and moon, Axis tilt and orbit inclination, Free movement and inspection, Zooming, Possibility to read information about objects 
Introduction
The advancement of innovation has expanded quickly and can be found
in practically all regions of human life, creator can discover one of them in the
field of instruction. These days, instruction learning is utilizing innovation so
as to play out the conveyance of material will turn out to be additionally
fascinating and simply memorable. The utilization of innovation in training can
be executed with a perception regarding a matter of study. The investigation
of the nearby planetary group for instance, by utilizing the representation of
articles in the close planetary system would encourage educators for the
conveyance of substance. Representation of the close planetary system is
changed in realistic or movement to show an assortment of heavenly items
that comprise a huge star called the sun, and all articles that are limited by
the power of gravity. The articles are eight planets that make a
transformation or turn of the sun and stay in circle individually.
Hence, the goal of the project is to create a program in OpenGL that
will accurately animate our Solar System.
In view of the things that have been portrayed out of sight of the
issue, we recognize a portion of the issues that exist, there are:
1. How does the way toward making the representation of the close
planetary system?
2. How to actualize a visual technique for finding out about the nearby
planetary group? 
Numerous issues that can happen, at that point we have confine
these issues by:
1. This close planetary system visualizer application utilizing API OpenGL.
2. This application just shows genuine examination of the width,
separation, path orbital direction, and speed of the planets around the
sun.
The motivation behind this application is as per the following:
1. To make a perception of the close planetary system.
2. To apply the visual technique for finding out about the close planetary
system.
3. To explore more details about the solar system.
The advantages of the examination are as per the following:
1. So as to be utilized as a kind of perspective during the time spent
representation of the nearby planetary group.
2. To act as a tool for learning about the solar system.
3. Can be used for an application that is generated for the solar system's
learning cycle.
OpenGL
OpenGL is a computer graphics which make an API, or we can say that OpenGL
is a computer graphics library. OpenGL is designed to be implemented as a
simplified, hardware-independent interface on several different hardware
platforms. OpenGL can be used to create interactive applications that render
color images of high quality composed of geometric 3D objects and pictures.
Method
Phases of making nearby planetary group representation: -
1. Proclaim all the characteristics that required for the console capacity and
revolution.
2. Set the speed of revolution of every planet, on the grounds that the speed
of every planet to make one upheaval is unique.
3. Make the sun with a strong circle, set the size, and position in the inside
point (0,0,0) so the sun turned into the focal point of planets that will
encompass them.
4. Make the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune with a strong circle, set the size of every planet, and the planet's
situation as per the proportion of the genuine separation.
5. Set the unrest of earth.
6. Make the circle of every planet, with torus (ring), set torus in the inside,
so the planets will move around the sun, and still stay in circle.
7. Make Keyboard work for controlling the development of the presentation.
8. Information the Sound, for make it appear as though all the more
fascinating.
9. Modify the lighting to give a 3D impact.
